SUMMARY:Archival Film Club: Watermelon Women
DESCRIPTION:Join us for a screening of Cheryl Dunye’s debut feature The Watermelon Woman (1996), a cult classic of the New Queer Cinema movement. The film follows Cheryl, a young Black lesbian filmmaker who’s attempting to make a documentary about Faye Richards, better known as the Watermelon Woman: an elusive Black actor whose uncredited roles in 1930s Old Hollywood films didn’t do justice to the complexities of her life and work. To support her filmmaking endeavours, Cheryl works at a video rental store with her friend Tamara, with and against whom she navigates creative ambition, queer identity, and the racialised and classed dynamics of lesbian dating.\nStraddling fact and fiction, The Watermelon Woman interrogates the marginalisation of queer Black women and women of colour both in the archive and in cinema history. In so doing, it asks vital questions about representational work within and beyond archives, about who gets to do the work of making histories and worlds, and about who is placed in the margins.\nThank you to Lucy Brownson for organising the screening.\n \nSign up here\n \n\n

SUMMARY:SAVANNA AND THE MOUNTAIN - benefit against extractivism
DESCRIPTION:Join us for the London debut of Paulo Carneiro’s Savanna and the Mountain (2024), a film that bears witness to the wildly unequal and vitally important struggle against lithium mining. Transcending the tradition of activist documentary filmmaking, it combines unconventional artistry with lived reality, weaving a nuanced tapestry of resistance that exposes the intricate power dynamics between folk stewardship of the environment and the vast machinery of global resource extraction.\nThe community of Covas do Barroso, in northern Portugal, discovers that the British company Savannah Resources plans to build the largest open-pit lithium mine in Europe just a few meters from their homes. Faced with this imminent threat, the People decide to organize themselves to expel the company from their lands.\nThe film will be followed by a panel discussion with Catarina from the local association resisting the mine, UDCB; expert on lithium mining community resistance in Chile, Linda Schilling Cuellar; and activist filmmaker Rich Felgate.\nAll proceeds go to supporting the local resistance struggle.\nScreening detailsGenesis cinema, London22 March 2025, 1pmTix: £10-18 (sliding scale)https://www.genesiscinema.co.uk/event/96469\n\n

SUMMARY:#BarrosoEmResistencia Fundraiser to support struggle against lithium mining and green capitalism
DESCRIPTION:#BarrosoEmResistencia\nFundraiser to support struggleagainst lithium mining and green capitalism\nconcerts, bar, conversation\nTrue mobsters do not get their hands dirty, they have the state infrastructure of the military, the police, the courts and the prisons to do their dirty work. Their intrusive machinery ravages mountains into craters, clear-cuts forests into deserts and contaminates pure, wild waters. Green capitalism promises to save humanity from extinction, while in reality, it only serves to profit billionaires.\nSavannah Resources Plc. is an enterprise listed on London Stock Exchange, which is proposing a 592ha lithium open-pit mining project in Barroso, in the north of the Iberian peninsula, machines subcontracted by them have invaded private and common lands - despite the population of this territory resisting for the past seven years. Since the camp with the Gira Zapatista Por La Vida, the resistance has been growing - refusing the idea of sacrifice zones locally and across the global south from Peru and Bolivia to DRCongo and Palestine.\nWe invite you to come to on the 22 of March gathering in London as a post-screening of the movie "Savana and the mountain" @Genesis, London at 1pm on the 22nd. \n\n

SUMMARY:Next Solfed Reading Group: Queering Anarchism part two
DESCRIPTION:The reading group we will continue reading Queering Anarchism, an anthology of essays. From the blurb:“What does it mean to “queer” the world around us? How does the radical refusal of the mainstream codification of LGBT identity as a new gender norm come into focus in the context of anarchist theory and practice? How do our notions of orientation inform our politics and vice versa? Queering Anarchism brings together a diverse set of writings ranging from the deeply theoretical to the playfully personal that explore the possibilities of the concept of “queering,” turning the dominant, and largely heteronormative, structures of belief and identity entirely inside out. Ranging in topic from the economy to disability, politics, social structures, sexual practice, interpersonal relationships, and beyond, the authors here suggest that queering might be more than a set of personal preferences, pointing toward the possibility of an entirely new way of viewing the world.”We started reading Queering Anarchism last month, and this month we will finish the book, starting from the essay Radical Queers and Class Struggle: A Match to Be Made.Free versions of Queering Anarchism can be found on the Anarchist Library here and our friends at Freedom Press here have offered a 10% discount on physical copies for the reading group. Just quote “London SolFed Reading Group” or pop into Freedom for your general radical book buying needs.The reading group will be meeting on Tuesday the 25h of March, 19:00, at Freedom Bookshop, 84b Whitechapel High St, London E1 7QX. You are welcome to come and join in the discussion even if you have not finished the book.\n\n

SUMMARY:Archiving from Below Discussion Series:  Archiving as a communist inventory? with Agit Press
DESCRIPTION:Sooner or later everything gets recuperated by our political enemies. Despite their warnings even the situationists were unable to escape this fate. Obviously, we don’t give up on militant ideas despite their capture, however we do need to take account of practices and tactics that we inherit from past movements, so as to assess their utility against present needs and constraints.\nIn this sense movement archives are not only repositories of communist history but can act as a way of constructing an inventory of the present movement. While archives often illuminate the intellectual history of the communist movement(s) – their theoretical and ideological debates, their statements, their policies and their campaigns –  they also contain a record of practices- the strategies and tactics that animated everyday activity.  As such, archives are a vital resource for the living movement. They are a toolbox – containing a wide range of tactics and strategies that must be unearthed and tested against our present realities.\nHow then can archives be structured to achieve this aim?\n \nSign up here\n \n \n \n\n

SUMMARY:BOOK TALK: Alt Reich by Nafeez Ahmed
DESCRIPTION:An evening with Dr Nafeez Ahmed, discussing his latest work of essential investigative journalism, ALT REICH: The Network War To Destroy The WestFrom WithinWhy does Elon Musk suddenly care about what’s happening in Britain?  Over the last 100 years, a shadowy network of American, British and European extremistsinspired by Nazi eugenics has worked feverishly to shape an insidious new fascism, masquerading under the banner of ‘freedom’. This is all revealed and expounded in Alt Reich, the new, vital, book from award-winning journalist Dr Nafeez Ahmed who will be joining us to discuss the far-right’s rise to the mainstream and reveal why and how this network emerged, who is behind it, how it works, and what it wants: to replace Western democracies with a global techno-authoritarian order that protects elite power in an age of planetary poly-crisis.  Ahmed explains Musk’s pivotal role in the network behind Trump’s return and the forming of a new ‘techno-utopian fascism’ that merges corporate tech power with the state. Musk and X are part of a broader network of billionaire oligarchs with questionable views on race, tech platforms, and far-right groups that are fed up with democracy as we know it. Russian President Vladimir Putin is an integral player in this network. And this has significant implications that the Western national security establishment ignores at everyone’s peril. Dr Nafeez Ahmed is a renowned systems theorist, change strategist and award-winninginvestigative journalist, formerly of The Guardian and VICE, who 15 years ago predicted themeteoric rise of the far-right across the West. A bestselling author of seven books including AUser’s Guide to the Crisis of Civilization, he is Byline Times’ Special Investigations Reporter AtLarge. His work has been officially used by the 9/11 Commission, the London bombingscoroner’s inquest and cited in the Congressional Record, as well as in the UK House ofCommons and House of Lords – including in multiple parliamentary select committee inquiries. Advanced booking strongly recommended. Doors open at 6:45, event starts 7:00. As always, tickets are priced on a sliding scale. If you are unable to pay for a ticket please do not hesitate to contact us at shop@housmans.com, and a free ticket will be made available.

SUMMARY:Critical Mass
DESCRIPTION:The London Mass meets at 7:00pm, on the last Friday of every month on the South Bank under Waterloo Bridge, by the British Film Institute.\n \nWHAT'S IS ALL ABOUT?Critical Mass is often described as an 'unorganised coincidence'. It happens when a lot of cyclists happen to be in the same place at the same time and decide to cycle the same way together for a while.\nWHAT'S THE PURPOSE?"Everyday, all over the world, people are resisting the problem culture of the car by getting on their bikes and riding, instead of driving.Critical Mass is a celebration of the alternatives to cars, pollution, accidents and the loss of public spaces and freedoms.Not an organisation or group, but an idea or tactic, Critical Mass allows people to reclaim cities with their bikes, just by getting together and out-numbering the cars on the road"\nWHAT HAPPENS ON A CRITICAL MASS?Each one is different and they follow no set route, with the direction being spontaneously chosen as people cycle along. Anyone is free to join or leave the ride as it pedals along.The ride lasts no more than a couple of hours (depending on the weather!) and usually ends in a conveniently placed pub (or squat) for more drinks.Most all, they are peaceful, safe and fun!\nDO I NEED A BIKE?Nope! Critical Mass is not just for bikes - skateboards, roller blades, wheelchairs, pogo sticks - in fact any form of non-motorised, non-polluting transport are all very welcome!\n\n

SUMMARY:BOOK LAUNCH: Renters Unite by Jacob Stringer
DESCRIPTION:Join us for an evening with Jacob Stringer as he discusses his vital new book Renters Unite: How Tenant Unions Are Fighting the Housing Crisis ‘Eye-opening, practical, thoughtful and revolutionary‘  – Danny Dorling, author of Peak Injustice: Solving Britain’s Inequality Crisis ‘A birds-eye view of tenant organizing across the global north that touches down in moving stories of everyday struggle, Renters Unite! is a generous and urgent reflection on the diversity of tactics in our movement—to turn individual fear into collective defiance, to deepen our roots in our communities, and to scale up our work to win the housing and the world we deserve‘  – Tracy Rosenthal, co-author of Abolish Rent Housmans is delighted to welcome long-time organizer Jacob Stringer to the shop to talk about his essential new book, penned from the front lines of the housing crisis. As housing crises proliferate around the world, so does the fightback. A new generation of tenants’ unions are rising up to demand good, affordable housing for all. From the streets of Los Angeles to the avenues of Berlin, these unions are rewriting the playbook on community empowerment and direct action. Stringer navigates the joys and perils of a new and exciting form of political organising. Through vivid storytelling and analysis, this book takes readers to the frontlines to expose the brutality of criminal landlords and exploitative housing.It’s time to say no to bad landlords and join the movement for housing justice! Jacob Stringer is a housing and social movements researcher, and a member of London Renters Union. His work has appeared in openDemocracy. He will be in conversation with researcher and activist Jess Adams from Newcastle University. Jess works in the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences Research Institutes: the Institute for Social Science, the Humanities Research Institute and Institute for Creative Arts Practice. Her research uses a militant methodology to understand contemporary notions of participation via an examination of her experience of participating in Corbynism and post-Corbynism.

SUMMARY:Book Launch: CTRL HATE DELETE by Cécile Simmons
DESCRIPTION:How did Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s divorce become the centre of the anti-#MeToo backlash? Why have so many teen boys fallen under the thrall of Andrew Tate, a failed reality show contestant? And why are a growing number of influencers like #tradwives dressing up like 1950s housewives and preaching total subservience to men? In the years since #MeToo – the largest social media facilitated feminist campaign in history – Roe v. Wade has been overturned in the United States, there have been attacks on reproductive rights in multiple countries and female political leaders have withdrawn from the world stage citing the level of abuse they get as a reason. Join us as we welcome Cécile Simmons to the shop to talk about her essential new book: CTRL HATE DELETE which takes a deep dive into how a collection of misogynists and their allies have turned male supremacist ideology from a niche set of beliefs into a mainstream movement. With interviews from experts, influencers and activists, it outlines how to fight the rising tide of online misogyny and make online spaces more equal and inclusive. Cécile Simmons is an investigative researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue focusing on disinformation, misogyny, and digital culture. She was previously an advisor to the charity Glitch, which focuses on ending gender-based online violence, and also advises tech companies, government bodies and civil society organisations on online harms. She has written for publications including The Guardian, Politico, WIRED and Cosmopolitan and appeared as an expert commentator on broadcast media including BBC Newsnight, France 24 and ABC News.

SUMMARY:Book Talk: THE WAGES OF DREAM WORK: Class Composition & the Social Reproduction of Cultural Labor
DESCRIPTION:Housmans are absolutely delighted to be welcoming Stevphen Shukaitis and Joanna Figiel to the shop to discuss their essential new book from Minor Compositions:The Wages of Dreamwork. Class Composition &amp; the Social Reproduction of Cultural Labor.  Surviving as a cultural or artistic worker in the city has never been easy. Creative workers find themselves celebrated as engines of economic growth, economic recovery and urban revitalization even as the conditions for our continued survival becomes more precarious. How can you make a living today in such a situation? That is, how to hold together the demands of paying the rent and bills while managing all the tasks necessary to support one’s practice? How to manage the tensions between creating spaces for creativity and imagination while working through the constraints posed by economic conditions? In a more traditional workplace it is generally easy to distinguish between those who planned and managed the labor process and those who were involved in its executions: between the managers and the managed. For creative workers these distinctions become increasingly hard to make. Today the passionate and self-motivated labor of the artisan increasingly becomes the model for a self-disciplining, self-managed labor force that works harder, longer, and often for less pay precisely because of its attachment to some degree of personal fulfillment in forms of engaging work. And that ain’t no way to make a living, having to struggle three times as hard for just to have a sense of engagement in meaningful work. The Wages of Dreamworkinvestigates how cultural workers in the modern metropolis manage these competing tensions and demands. Does the cultural economy treat you as a tool? If so, perhaps it’s time to rethink how to down tools in this metropolitan factory. As always, tickets are priced on a sliding scale. If you are unable to pay for a ticket please do not hesitate to contact us at shop@housmans.com, and a free ticket will be made available.

SUMMARY:EVIL SWORD + SHAKE CHAIN + SPLIT APEX
DESCRIPTION:Upset The Rhythm presents...\nEVIL SWORDSHAKE CHAINSPLIT APEXSaturday 5 AprilNew River Studios, 199 Eade Rd, Harringay, London, N4 1DN7.30pm | £8 | Tickets: https://link.dice.fm/B1970de44fb0\nEVIL SWORD are Kate Ferencz and Ben Furgal from Philadelphia, USA. Their chaotic live shows combine elements of noise, cryptic metal overtones, performance art, and gallows humor and feature macabre props, flashing lights, stage sets and costumes. There are hardly any instruments in this group, but they make such a racket you'd never know it. The bass and the percussion sound like they're having a great time, telling each other jokes. Then the words come in and it all locks together in these strange, hypnotic rhythms. I just listen to the stories and laugh and cry and get scared and wonder what they were ever thinking.Recent album 'Basket Fever' (Magic Pictures, 2023) features electrocuted bells, backwards parts, rusty horns; I'm pretty sure I even heard a clarinet in there somewhere. There's this one part where it all seems to come back around, where they took some gang vocals from the very first demo they ever recorded and slowed it way down. When they first started; I thought they were some goofy kids making music about the end of the world, back when that seemed a little further away, like it was going to be fun. They were all laughing and making these funny ghost sounds, but now everyone's older and the ghosts are real, a great whoosh of bygone spirits and cold air. It's bone chilling. There's plenty to be upset about, but it's not really an Evil Sword song until that grimace has been twisted up into a smile.\nhttps://evilsword.bandcamp.com/album/basket-fever\nSHAKE CHAIN have been busy demolishing audiences and expectations for the best part of the last five years. Vocalist Kate Mahony sets that standard by anything from crawling through the audience's legs in a bright yellow raincoat to crying and washing her hands in a nearby toilet, as the rest of the band start the set. The four-piece from London are completed by Robert Eyres (Synth/Guitar), Chris Hopkins (Bass/Synth/Samples) and Joe Fergey (Drums). Shake Chain are built of nervy bass lines, twitchy guitars that jolt and jerk and tack sharp drums, overridden by screeching vocal slurs and sampled television. Kate's singing is a unique embrace of flights of atonal fancy, head-first repetition and ecstatic frenzy. Opinion-dividing arguably, but singular in making Shake Chain dauntingly brilliant. The band's debut album 'Snake Chain' was released by Upset The Rhythm.\nhttps://upsettherhythm.bandcamp.com/album/snake-chain  \n                                     SPLIT APEX are Jussi Palmusaari (guitar, electronics and percussion) and Peter Blundell (voice and bass). On their self-titled cassette (out now) release they combine restless sonic textures, oddball phrasing within barely-contained song structures held together by moth-woven threads. Seemingly governed by an unknowable gravitational pull that tugs hither and yon, the duo lays out their statement of intent through a brief suite of intimate nocturnes. The release marks the first work for Palmusaari since leaving his native Finland where he played with the band, Preesens, in the late-90s/early-00s. For Blundell, this new project exists adjacent to his current work with Dominic Goodman as Komare and previous endeavours in the band, Mosquitoes.\nhttps://tinyurl.com/n8cf2jhf\n\n

SUMMARY:'Anrcho-Punk: Music and Resistance in London 1977-88' with David Insurrection and Tony Drayton
DESCRIPTION:To celebrate the publication of 'Anrcho-Punk: Music and Resistance in London 1977-88' we are excited to host author David Insurrection and Tony Drayton to discuss the themes and content of this new book.'Anarcho-Punk: Music and Resistance in London 1977-1988' by David Insurrection is the distillation of three years work. It’s the story of an oft overlooked scene. Anarcho-punk in the 1980s truly rocked the boat. Much more than music it set out to change the world and in a not insignificant way did just that. It inspired a generation of activists, artists and musicians to take up the fight for a better fairer world. They tore down the walls. The Sex Pistols may have opened the door but the Crass punks charged through it. This is their story. As we return to the embattled 1970s and 1980s David takes us on a journey where we visit some of the scene’s most significant locations and hot spots, to places where change mattered and the spirit of revolt burned brightest.About the author:David Insurrection was born in 1962 and raised in NE Scotland. He’s married with one daughter. At the age of 17 in the autumn of 1979 he discovered punk rock. It would leave a lasting impression on him. In 1980 he first heard Crass. That experience changed everything and would determine the direction his life took from that point onwards. In 1984 he began to identify as an anarchist and took his first activist steps. By this time he had immersed himself in everything anarcho-punk. In 1988 he produced his first zine. His next zine in 1990 was called Insurrection. In 1993 he moved to London. He stayed there for four and a half years returning to his native Scotland in 1997. It was during his stay in London that he first got a hankering for writing a book on anarcho-punk. He’s still involved in the scene to this day.\n\n

SUMMARY:Book Launch: We Are Not Anonymous by Stephen Oram
DESCRIPTION:A Working Utopia? In a near-future England, fractured into three nations and ravaged by climate floods, Naomi, a fiercely determined activist, and Beth, her courageous partner, fight for a better world. Their love deepens as they take on Kai, the ruthless leader of the tech-elite Narcissists, whose experiments on children and government-controlling technology threaten to reshape humanity itself.  As part of the activist group Resist and Regain, Beth and Naomi battle to subvert Kai’s ambitions and create a more equal and transparent world. But as the stakes rise, Beth must face a harrowing choice: should she try to dismantle Kai’s regime at the cost of her family’s safety—and their future? Housmans is delighted to launch Stephen Oram’s sci-fi thriller We Are Not Anonymous with a probing conversation exploring some of its major themes between Oram and Eva Pascoe, co-chair of CyberSalon. We will never agree what utopia looks like; a utopia for some is a dystopia for others. Should we simply forget our attempts to define what utopia looks like? Should we, instead, agree on how we organise ourselves and make our decisions; our continuous process of becoming? With the rise of the tech oligarchs and their algorithms dividing us, how do we resist? Their rapid development of technology is unlikely to slow down, but can we use it for communal benefit? We Are Not Anonymous  is an accessible sci-fi thriller rooted in today’s concerns about AI, billionaire tech barons, climate change, politics and government, personal rights, data ownership and police militarization. But it’s also an inspiring story about the power of activism, community and the resourcefulness of humanity. “Stephen Oram combines gripping storytelling with scientific literacy and original SF. Instead of rearranging tropes he comes up with new ideas.” Geoff Ryman, multi-award-winning author of HIM. “Now that we’ve lived into the future that cyberpunk projected, we urgently need to fight our way out. This book imagines and encourages that fight.” Ken MacLeod, multi-award winning author. “A frighteningly credible near-future dystopia that is as convincing as it is disturbing, We Are Not Anonymous unfolds with cinematic scale and urgency.” Ewan Morrison, award winning author and essayist. “An intellectually arresting, thought-provoking work of creative futurism that drives our current politics and technology to their magical — and logical — extremes.” Ana Sun, author. “Stephen Oram combines gripping storytelling with scientific literacy and original SF. Instead of rearranging tropes he comes up with new ideas.” Geoff Ryman, multi-award-winning author of HIM. “A gripping near future yarn, We Are Not Anonymous is an inspiring story for those who believe that courage can outmatch control.” Eva Pascoe, co-founder of digital futures think tank, Cybersalon. STEPHEN ORAM writes social science fiction set in the near-future, exploring the intersection of messy humans and imperfect technology. Previously, he has two published novels, three collections of sci-fi shorts and is published in many anthologies, including the award-winning Best of British Science Fiction 2022 (Newcon Press). He also works with scientists and technologists to explore possible outcomes of their research with the public through short stories and has co-edited four anthologies along these lines. Previously, he was the head of policy for post-16 skills strategic development and innovation at the Department for Education.  Stephen is based in the heart of central London and, alongside his experience of living inside and outside of the establishment, he attributes much of the urban grittiness and the optimism about humanity in his writing to the noise, the bustle, and the diverse community of where he lives. EVA PASCOE is co-chairperson of CyberSalon and has pioneered ecommerce in the UK. She was a co-founder of Cyberia, the first global cybercafé chain and Easynet Internet Service Provider. She has recently co-authored digital retail policy papers on “Re-Imagining the High Street” and a new policy for West End of London in her “Surf and Turf” contribution to a recent publication commissioned by Centre for London and New West End Company. She regularly speaks at key retail industry events run by the Retail Institute and runs a weekly digital innovations blog “The Retail Bytes” at steering the sector through technological challenges. Eva has been at the forefront of the commercialisation of the Internet since the 1990s, contributing significantly to retail practice, public policy, training and education ever since.

SUMMARY:WOLF EYES + SLY & THE FAMILY DRONE + SOBORGNOST
DESCRIPTION:Upset The Rhythm presents...\nWOLF EYESSLY &amp; THE FAMILY DRONESOBORGNOSTThursday 10 AprilThe Underworld, 174 Camden High St, London, NW1 9DL7pm | £15 | Tickets: https://link.dice.fm/qa5f170d34a7\nWOLF EYES have spent 25 years fusing together DIY electronics with the avant-garde sensibilities of Fluxus and the granite of dreary Midwestern life. Their new album 'Dreams In Splattered Lines' is a surreal dreamscape of disorienting sound collages, where hit songs are transformed into terrariums of sonic flora and decimated fauna. As if pulled from a fever dream, the surrealists of the 1960s converge with alien electronic blues musicians in an underworld of mystery. The air is thick with car wash radio white noise, crackling and fizzing like a toxic elixir, spoken word poetry transmissions as absurd and cryptic phrases. Each corroded aural environment is a microcosm of chaos, honed to razor-sharp precision. Swept away in a whirlwind of thirteen perplexing narratives, each one an unpredictable journey through subterranean worlds, a sonic trip of reality folded into itself. Wolf Eyes have released three albums recently ‘Dreams In Splattered Lines' was preceded by the compilation of collaborations 'Presents Difficult Messages', and the band followed this up with the release of 'Wolf Eyes w/ Spykes', bringing a much sought after early release to vinyl for the first time, documenting a recording session pivotal to the ongoing development of the group’s sound. Alongside this has been the usual steady stream of lathe cuts, side hustles, art and inzanity. A new LP is due out soon charting Wolf Eyes’ recent recordings with Anthony Braxton too, look out!\nhttps://wolfeyes.xyz/ \nSLY &amp; THE FAMILY DRONE are a primal orchestra of drum rhythms, radiophonic oscillator noise and electronically-abstracted vocals. They forge hypnotic, textural workouts in the vein of Black Dice, Shit &amp; Shine and Crash Worship. Given their freeform nature, every set they play is fresh and different. The band prefer to play in the round, rather than onstage, transforming the audience from passive observers to active contributors, creating a dynamic and evolving soundscape. This egalitarian approach propels audience and band together into a shamanistic setting of catharsis and anarchic celebration.Originally formed by Matt Cargill as a cassette manipulation project. Since then, Sly have expanded to incorporate layers of electronics, clattering live drums and saxophones, placing them somewhere between noise music and free jazz. Imagine a Boredoms score for an experimental noir thriller and you might be getting close. The neo-jazz wreckin’ crew continue to scorch their own path, recently teaming up with UK charitable label Human Worth on the release of their new record ‘Moon is Doom Backwards’.https://familydrone.bandcamp.com/\nSOBORGNOST is sci-fi dance punk at the intersection of vaporwave, minimal wave, disco dub, industrial, EBM, proto-house, drone and noise. Using a hardware sampler to emulate dub mixing, looping post-punk style basslines with chuggy, lo-fi beats. Warped analogue textures are added with cassette tape manipulation, electro magnetic frequency transmitters, shortwave radio, harsh noise generator and dub sirens.https://soundcloud.com/spirit-data\n\n

From 2pm we also have an infoshop with zines/stickers/more, and a free shop/book swap/clothes swap including free binders from Gender Swap. \nThe cafe takes place every second Saturday of the month at Halkevi, the Kurdish community centre in Dalston (London), with open assemblies every Tuesdays before and after the event. \nThe space is wheelchair accessible (through the Tyssen Street entrance).\n\n

SUMMARY:BOOK LAUNCH: Flatline Contstructs by Mark Fisher
DESCRIPTION:JOIN US IN CELEBRATING THE HIGHLY ANTICIPATED REISSUE OF MARK FISHER’S FIRST BOOK‘Flatline Constructs is Mark Fisher’s piercing précis of the metaphysics of cybernetics, whose herald is Spinoza. Fisher’s ‘gothic flatline’ annuls the difference between fiction and reality, obliterating representation with circuitry, the mirror with the screen, and law with code. If ‘Flatline Constructs’ principal tropes — machinic animism and agency without subjectivity — have become theoretical commonplaces in the 25 years since its composition, its publication now retrospectively illuminates the political debility of a cybernetic realism that snuffs out every alternative to the present. Flatline Constructs diagnoses the paralyzing predicament which Fisher’s subsequent work would struggle to overcome.’  — Ray Brassier We are honored to be hosting the official launch for Flatline Constructs, Mark Fisher’s first book, drawn from the doctorate he completed at Warwick University, while he was involved with the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU). Seminal and hauntingly prescient, this vital work of cyber-theory is finally getting a wider release, and not a moment too soon; trapped, as we are, in an increasingly fascistic techno-capitalistic continuum, Mark Fisher’s ideas, particularly those developed here, become ever more alive and alert. Flatline Constructs invents a fusion of culture, critique, and radical philosophy that would define Fisher’s signature style from Capitalist Realism to Acid Communism. Drawing on sources from David Cronenberg to Gilles Deleuze and William Gibson, Fisher presents a Gothic vision of Cyberpunk reality, in which Man and media are drawn ever closer together, and life and death are never truly far apart. The new edition features a brilliant introduction by the philosopher Adam C. Jones, who will be joining us to discuss the book and it’s wider legacy alongside Mattie Colquhoun.  Mark Fisher (1968 – 2017) was a co-founder of Zer0 Books and, later, Repeater Books. His blog, k-punk, defined critical writing for a generation. He wrote three books, Capitalist Realism, Ghosts of My Life and The Weird and the Eerie, and was based at the Visual Cultures department at Goldsmiths, University of London. Adam C. Jones is a philosopher from East London, UK whose work focuses on Insurrectionary Communist thought, cybernetics, and the ways in which systems of social control function today. For the past four years he has co-hosted the hit podcast Acid Horizon, with whom he wrote Anti-Oculus: A Philosophy of Escape. His first book The New Flesh: Life and Death in the Data Economy was published by Zer0 in 2024.  Mattie Colquhoun is a writer and photographer from Hull. They are the author of Egress: On Mourning, Melancholy and Mark Fisher (Repeater, 2020), Narcissus in Bloom: An Alternative History of the Selfie (Repeater, 2023) and editor of Mark Fisher’s Postcapitalist Desire lectures (Repeater, 2021). Currently a PhD candidate in Philosophy at Newcastle University, they blog at xenogothic.com. We anticipate this will be a very popular event, so advanced booking is strongly recommended.  As always, tickets are priced on a sliding scale. If you are unable to pay for a ticket please do not hesitate to contact us at shop@housmans.com, and a free ticket will be made available.

SUMMARY:News From Nowhere Club: The Shrewsbury 24 Campaign – We Never Gave Up!  
DESCRIPTION:The Shrewsbury 24 Campaign – We Never Gave Up!  Speaker: Eileen Turnbull    \nEileen is the researcher &amp; secretary of the Shrewsbury 24 Campaign, formed in 2006 to overturn a miscarriage of justice. The 24 were North Wales building workers, prosecuted in 1973-74 for alleged picketing offences during the national building workers’ strike. Six received prison sentences ranging from 4 months to 3 years; 16 were given suspended prison sentences. Through years of research, Eileen discovered the crucial fresh evidence that persuaded the Criminal Cases Review Commission to refer the case back to the Court of Appeal.  In 2021 three judges quashed all the pickets’ convictions. Eileen will recount the manipulation of the original trials by the judiciary, politicians &amp; media, which came to light only in the course of her research. This is an intriguing story, told with seriousness, passion &amp; a touch of humour.\n_____________________________________________________________________\nFree entryDonations/Raffle/Voluntary Membership £5pa7.30pm Buffet (please bring an item if you can: vegetarian or vegan only)No entry before 7.30pm please (unless specified)8.00pm Talk and discussion till about 10pm\n_____________________________________________________________________\nAbout the News From Nowhere Club“Fellowship is life and the lack of fellowship is death.”   William Morris\nFounded in 1996, the club challenges the commercialisation, isolation and privatisation of modern life.

SUMMARY:Practical Squatters Evening @ a local squat!
DESCRIPTION:By squatters for squatters!\nJoin us for evenings of practical squatting knowledge, skillshares, and meeting squatters new and old. Whether you're looking to join a crew, looking for more people to join your crew, or just coming along to skill up, we hope that Practical Squatters Evenings can provide something for everyone, and bring together people in the squat scene in London.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAfter a recent meeting, the Practical Squatters Network has decided on some changes to make the network and monthly sessions more useful to people looking to know more about squatting or to share and improve their skills in many of the aspects of squatting life.\nThe Practical Squatters Network has been operating for countless years running regular sessions to introduce people to squatting, and to help those already squatting to meet others and share skills. The frequency of meetups along with the content has changed over years according to the changing landscape of squatting in the UK, but currently runs once a month on the 3rd Monday. It fluctuates between being hosted at Decentre, above Freedom Bookshop, and on alternate months in a local squat.\nGoing forward all Practical Squatters Evenings will take place in a local squat, only using Decentre or other anarchist social centres as backup venues in the case a squat falls through for whatever reason. They will continue to run regularly on the 3rd Monday of the month.\nEach session will also take a particular focus on a topic or skillshare, to make sessions of more use to people who have already attended previously and heard the usual introductory speil. There will still be fair focus given to anyone who is new and ensure they are not left behind with questions about the basics of squatting.\n \n\n

SUMMARY:Critical Mass
DESCRIPTION:The London Mass meets at 7:00pm, on the last Friday of every month on the South Bank under Waterloo Bridge, by the British Film Institute.\n \nWHAT'S IS ALL ABOUT?Critical Mass is often described as an 'unorganised coincidence'. It happens when a lot of cyclists happen to be in the same place at the same time and decide to cycle the same way together for a while.\nWHAT'S THE PURPOSE?"Everyday, all over the world, people are resisting the problem culture of the car by getting on their bikes and riding, instead of driving.Critical Mass is a celebration of the alternatives to cars, pollution, accidents and the loss of public spaces and freedoms.Not an organisation or group, but an idea or tactic, Critical Mass allows people to reclaim cities with their bikes, just by getting together and out-numbering the cars on the road"\nWHAT HAPPENS ON A CRITICAL MASS?Each one is different and they follow no set route, with the direction being spontaneously chosen as people cycle along. Anyone is free to join or leave the ride as it pedals along.The ride lasts no more than a couple of hours (depending on the weather!) and usually ends in a conveniently placed pub (or squat) for more drinks.Most all, they are peaceful, safe and fun!\nDO I NEED A BIKE?Nope! Critical Mass is not just for bikes - skateboards, roller blades, wheelchairs, pogo sticks - in fact any form of non-motorised, non-polluting transport are all very welcome!\n\n

SUMMARY:BOOK TALK: SQUATTING LONDON with Samuel Burgum
DESCRIPTION:Squatting in London has a rich and diverse history. Today, squatters live a marginalised, stigmatised and criminalised existence, yet they persist. Behind the glittering façade of shiny new buildings, London is a network of vacant offices, boarded-up shops and dilapidated pubs that host some of the city’s poorest and most determined citizens, exiled and increasingly pushed to the margins. We are very excited to welcome Samuel Burgum to Housmans to talk about his vital new book about a facinating, and much neglected, part of our urban history. Squatting London: The Politics of Property is an account of the real lives of the city’s squatters: their ambitions and struggles. Squatting is a challenge to the logic of property which underpins the city. By finding refuge, staying put, creating spaces and participating in counter-cultures, squats are political acts. They sit in direct opposition to the speculation, gentrification and regeneration that controls London today. From wasted office blocks transformed into a life-saving homeless shelter, to temporary art exhibitions and raves; from an empty doctor’s surgery, to a library closed by cuts; from mutual aid networks set up during the pandemic, to restaurants, shops, offices and pubs – Squatting London is an alternative, underground and rebellious ethnographic account of a city you thought you already knew. Samuel Burgum is an urban sociologist, currently conducting a Leverhulme-sponsored ethnographic project on squatting in the context of the UK’s housing crisis. He is the author of Occupying London: Post-Crash Resistance and the Limits of Possibility. He has written for various journals, including Antipode, The Sociological Review and Journal for Cultural Research. As always, tickets are priced on a sliding scale. If you are unable to pay for a ticket please do not hesitate to contact us at shop@housmans.com, and a free ticket will be made available. If you choose ‘book + event entry’ or ‘special bundle’, your copies of the book will be available to collect on the evening. If you would like to collect it earlier, or arrange for delivery, please contact us (postage is £2.95). Telephone 020 7837 4473 or email shop@housmans.com. Doors Open at 6:45pm, Event Starts 7:00\n\n

SUMMARY:News From Nowhere Club: What can be done about the social care crisis?
DESCRIPTION:What can be done about the social care crisis? Speaker: Anne GrayLike many other ‘developed’ countries, Britain has an ageing society; more &amp; more people need care in older age. Disability’s also increasing.  60% of us will experience caring for another adult some time in our lives – our partner, parents, another relative or friend. Disabled children often remain dependent on their parents till both generations are growing old.  For years, successive governments have done little or nothing about this. Budgets for social care are just not keeping pace with need, so many people pay for their own professional care or do without. Some have relatives available to help but an increasing number don’t.  Anne will explore some solutions to these problems from her book, A Radical Approach to the Care Crisis;Community, Solidarity and a National Care Service, to be published by Bristol University Press in April 2025.  There will be signed copies for sale.\n_____________________________________________________________________\nFree entryDonations/Raffle/Voluntary Membership £5pa7.30pm Buffet (please bring an item if you can: vegetarian or vegan only)No entry before 7.30pm please (unless specified)8.00pm Talk and discussion till about 10pm\n_____________________________________________________________________\nAbout the News From Nowhere Club“Fellowship is life and the lack of fellowship is death.”   William Morris\nFounded in 1996, the club challenges the commercialisation, isolation and privatisation of modern life.

SUMMARY:Critical Mass
DESCRIPTION:The London Mass meets at 7:00pm, on the last Friday of every month on the South Bank under Waterloo Bridge, by the British Film Institute.\n \nWHAT'S IS ALL ABOUT?Critical Mass is often described as an 'unorganised coincidence'. It happens when a lot of cyclists happen to be in the same place at the same time and decide to cycle the same way together for a while.\nWHAT'S THE PURPOSE?"Everyday, all over the world, people are resisting the problem culture of the car by getting on their bikes and riding, instead of driving.Critical Mass is a celebration of the alternatives to cars, pollution, accidents and the loss of public spaces and freedoms.Not an organisation or group, but an idea or tactic, Critical Mass allows people to reclaim cities with their bikes, just by getting together and out-numbering the cars on the road"\nWHAT HAPPENS ON A CRITICAL MASS?Each one is different and they follow no set route, with the direction being spontaneously chosen as people cycle along. Anyone is free to join or leave the ride as it pedals along.The ride lasts no more than a couple of hours (depending on the weather!) and usually ends in a conveniently placed pub (or squat) for more drinks.Most all, they are peaceful, safe and fun!\nDO I NEED A BIKE?Nope!

SUMMARY:News From Nowhere Club: Broadwater Farm: Transformed!
DESCRIPTION:Broadwater Farm: Transformed!\nSpeaker: Clasford Stirling MBE  \nHow is it that a notorious housing estate (‘one of the worst in the UK’) later had a waiting list? Crime rates on Broadwater Farm plummeted: by 2005, only 2% of residents said they felt unsafe there (the lowest rate in London.) In 1985, after Cynthia Jarrett’s death nearby when police raided her home, a riot took place; PC Blakelock was killed. Things had to change. Clasford, a life-long resident, has made huge contributions to the changes, creating a Youth Association, football coaching (making professional players), helping to unite residents (the Residents Association had been all-white on a multi-ethnic estate.) Broadwater Farm, run by LB Haringey, saw vast improvements physically, socially &amp; economically. Clasford will explain how he &amp; others achieved this miracle, &amp; what it’s like to grow up &amp; live there in 2025.\n_____________________________________________________________________\nFree entryDonations/Raffle/Voluntary Membership £5pa7.30pm Buffet (please bring an item if you can: vegetarian or vegan only)No entry before 7.30pm please (unless specified)8.00pm Talk and discussion till about 10pm\n_____________________________________________________________________\nAbout the News From Nowhere Club“Fellowship is life and the lack of fellowship is death.”   William Morris\nFounded in 1996, the club challenges the commercialisation, isolation and privatisation of modern life.

SUMMARY:Practical Squatters Evening @ a local squat!
DESCRIPTION:By squatters for squatters!\nJoin us for evenings of practical squatting knowledge, skillshares, and meeting squatters new and old. Whether you're looking to join a crew, looking for more people to join your crew, or just coming along to skill up, we hope that Practical Squatters Evenings can provide something for everyone, and bring together people in the squat scene in London.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAfter a recent meeting, the Practical Squatters Network has decided on some changes to make the network and monthly sessions more useful to people looking to know more about squatting or to share and improve their skills in many of the aspects of squatting life.\nThe Practical Squatters Network has been operating for countless years running regular sessions to introduce people to squatting, and to help those already squatting to meet others and share skills. The frequency of meetups along with the content has changed over years according to the changing landscape of squatting in the UK, but currently runs once a month on the 3rd Monday. It fluctuates between being hosted at Decentre, above Freedom Bookshop, and on alternate months in a local squat.\nGoing forward all Practical Squatters Evenings will take place in a local squat, only using Decentre or other anarchist social centres as backup venues in the case a squat falls through for whatever reason. They will continue to run regularly on the 3rd Monday of the month.\nEach session will also take a particular focus on a topic or skillshare, to make sessions of more use to people who have already attended previously and heard the usual introductory speil. There will still be fair focus given to anyone who is new and ensure they are not left behind with questions about the basics of squatting.\n \n\n

SUMMARY:News From Nowhere Club: Resisting racist and state violence in east London 
DESCRIPTION:Resisting racist and state violence in east London Speaker: Kevin Blowe of NetPol\nLast summer, thousands of people gathered in Walthamstow, as riots erupted around the country, to resist threats of far-right protests against local immigration advice services. This counter-demonstration was widely praised in the media &amp; by politicians, in marked contrast to the relentlessly negative portrayal of ordinary people offering a similar kind of solidarity to besieged Palestinians in Gaza as ‘hate marches.’ One reason why so many felt the need to oppose the far right was the chaotic, inadequate way police in other parts of the country had responded to anti-migrant violence: in Bristol only days before, local people had been forced to physically protect a hotel where asylum-seekers were staying. There was a strong sense the police were more concerned with the government’s demands to crack down on Palestine protests than with violent racist groups. Kevin, campaigns coordinator of the Network for Police Monitoring, was an activist for 26 years with the anti-racist &amp; police monitoring group, the Newham Monitoring Project.  He argues the idea that ‘the police don’t protect us’ is deeply embedded in the struggles for justice by black &amp; Asian communities in east London &amp; that there’s much we can learn from the history of these struggles: about how to sustain opposition to both the far right &amp; state violence for longer than just one warm summer evening. \n_____________________________________________________________________\nFree entryDonations/Raffle/Voluntary Membership £5pa7.30pm Buffet (please bring an item if you can: vegetarian or vegan only)No entry before 7.30pm please (unless specified)8.00pm Talk and discussion till about 10pm\n_____________________________________________________________________\nAbout the News From Nowhere Club“Fellowship is life and the lack of fellowship is death.”   William Morris\nFounded in 1996, the club challenges the commercialisation, isolation and privatisation of modern life.

SUMMARY:News From Nowhere Club: Ignatius Sancho: from Slave Ship to Westminster
DESCRIPTION:Ignatius Sancho: from Slave Ship to Westminster  Speaker: Chris Harrison  Among many prominent black 18th century British citizens, Ignatius Sancho is distinguished for the breadth of his interests &amp; the range of his social contacts. A writer, composer &amp; owner of a small business, he was acquainted with many important figures of his time, including Laurence Sterne, David Garrick, Joseph Nollekens &amp; the Montagu family. He is one of the first black Britons to have voted in a general election – a considerable achievement for someone thought to have been born on a slave ship crossing the Atlantic. Chris Harrison, musician &amp; educator, has done much to raise awareness of Sancho’s life &amp; work &amp; will tell the story of how Sancho made this remarkable journey, illustrated by a live performance by members of the Hackney Community Orchestra (of which Chris is musical director) of some of Sancho’s music.\n_____________________________________________________________________\nFree entryDonations/Raffle/Voluntary Membership £5pa7.30pm Buffet (please bring an item if you can: vegetarian or vegan only)No entry before 7.30pm please (unless specified)8.00pm Talk and discussion till about 10pm\n_____________________________________________________________________\nAbout the News From Nowhere Club“Fellowship is life and the lack of fellowship is death.”   William Morris\nFounded in 1996, the club challenges the commercialisation, isolation and privatisation of modern life.

SUMMARY:News From Nowhere Club: CLR James: An Unexpected Life 
DESCRIPTION:CLR James: An Unexpected Life \nSpeaker: John L. WilliamsJohn will be talking about his biography of the great Trinidadian historian, radical &amp; cricket-lover: CLR James. His book brings this extraordinary 20th century life into brilliant focus as it moves from Trinidad to London to Lancashire to the USA &amp; back again. ‘CLR James was decades ahead of his time in challenging our thoughts about empire, colonialism, black history &amp;, not least, in writing brilliantly about cricket. He finally has the biography his extraordinary influence deserves’ (Barney Ronay). John is a Cardiff-born novelist &amp; biographer; his subjects range from American crime fiction to Dame Shirley Bassey. Benjamin Zephaniah described John’s account of the Cardiff 3 case, Bloody Valentine, as his favourite book. \n_____________________________________________________________________\nFree entryDonations/Raffle/Voluntary Membership £5pa7.30pm Buffet (please bring an item if you can: vegetarian or vegan only)No entry before 7.30pm please (unless specified)8.00pm Talk and discussion till about 10pm\n_____________________________________________________________________\nAbout the News From Nowhere Club“Fellowship is life and the lack of fellowship is death.”   William Morris\nFounded in 1996, the club challenges the commercialisation, isolation and privatisation of modern life.
